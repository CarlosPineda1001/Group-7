    <h2><center>What is the Sandwich Club?</center></h2>

<p>The Sandwich Club is an exclusive experience for those who not only love the sandwhich,
    but have imbedded themselves within the experience of the sandwich. This club is not for the faint of heart. The flavors and textures are too much to handle for ordinary people. This service will deliver you freshly made sandwiches for the duration of your subscription. You wont be able to choose what kind of sandwich you will receive because all of our sandwiches are just that good.
